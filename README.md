# Simon (Ambient Edition)

"Simon" has long been a fantastic memory game to play, but quite frankly...a little chaotic to me. The game's lights and sounds can be a little noisy for my taste, so much that it honestly trips me up a bit when trying to play.
  
This is where the ambient version of Simon comes in.
Not that anyone asked for it, but I'm choosing sanity while working on strengthening my memory versus losing my marbles over pressing some color buttons for fun.
