# SIMON (SAYS)

*revisit 1994 - 1998 simon? chaotic simon?*

"Simon's a computer, Simon has a brain, you either do what Simon says or else go down the drain (1994-1998)"



Breakdown:

In Simon, there are four color buttons (four identical caved in trapezoids) [in clockwise order from top left]:
    - Green
    - Red
    - Blue
    - Yellow

(getting the right trapezoid shapes may be a version 2 or 3 thing)



the logo "SIMON" is in the center of the game board
a power on/start button is placed above the logo

when the power button is pressed, a startup sequence
is initiated where a startup sound starts playing as well as the buttons flash in a specific clockwise order as follows:

# STARTUP SEQUENCE (VERSION 2/3):

- red -> blue -> yellow -> green
- red -> blue -> yellow -> green
(this sequence runs a total of TWO times, one second flash per button)

AFTER the individual button sequence repeats,
- all buttons flash simultaneously THREE TIMES
(one second per button flash)

# GAME ON (AFTER STARTUP SEQUENCE) (VERSION 1):

after initiating the startup sequence, if the player does not physically click/push a button, the following sequence happens:

the green button will blink NO MORE THAN TEN times (one button blink representing one second).


# SPECIAL TUTORIAL SEQUENCE (VERSION 3):

when SIMON is on, and as the green button is blinking its 10 times, the user can hold the button for three seconds and have a special tutorial sequence initiate!

as sequence initiates:

*SPECIAL TUTORIAL SEQUENCE SOUND BITE PLAYS*


a special tutorial initiate happens (very similar to the startup sequence, but much faster, maybe 0.25 seconds for each button):

red -> blue -> yellow -> green 
*BUTTONS FLASH (NO SOUND)*

*ALL BUTTONS FLASH SIMULTANEOUSLY TWICE*
*SOUND BITE PLAYS AS BUTTONS FLASH SIMULTANEOUSLY*

*GREEN BUTTON FLASHES QUICKLY 5 TIMES*
*GREEN BUTTON START INDICATOR SOUND BITE PLAYS QUICKLY(ALONG WITH THE FLASHING)*


# PLAYING THE GAME























# AUTOMATIC SHUTOFF (VERSION 2/3):

if SIMON is left idle, after ten green button blinks/seconds, a special automatic shutoff AUDIO sound sets off and the ENTIRE GAME powers down.



YOU CANNOT TURN OFF THE GAME BY PRESSING THE TURN ON BUTTON. YOU CAN ONLY TURN THE GAME ON. THE GAME ONLY SHUTS OFF AUTOMATICALLY AFTER THE PARAMETERS FOR STARTING THE AUTOMATIC SHUTOFF SEQUENCE ARE MET (LEAVING THE GAME ALONE FOR TEN SECONDS)





ASSETS SO FAR:

# Sounds:
STARTUP SEQUENCE SOUND BITE
AUTOMATIC SHUTOFF FALLBACK SOUND BITE

# Buttons:
RED
GREEN
YELLOW
BLUE

# FLASH TYPES (PER SECOND):
NORMAL FLASH - 1 SECOND
QUICK FLASH - 0.25 SECONDS



version 3 ideas:
- color-blind mode for color-blind users
- tracks wins and losses
- enable hard mode (very fast)
